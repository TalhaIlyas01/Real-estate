Townhouses are often characterized by their vertical orientation, typically having multiple floors and a compact footprint. Here is a general description of a townhouse. A townhouse usually has a charming and aesthetically pleasing exterior design. It can feature various architectural styles such as Victorian, Georgian, Colonial, or contemporary designs. The exterior facade may be made of brick, stucco, siding, or a combination of materials. Townhouses often have a front entrance facing the street, and some may have a small front yard or a patio area. Townhouses are designed to maximize living space in a relatively narrow footprint. They typically have two or more floors, connected by staircases. The ground floor usually consists of common areas such as a living room, dining room, and kitchen. Some townhouses may also have a small entry foyer or a hallway leading to the main living area. The upper floors usually house the bedrooms, bathrooms, and sometimes additional living spaces like a loft or a study.",
